# timetable_parser
A parser for the University of Leicester Computer Science department timetable.

## Running
1.  Edit the configuration file to include your specific modules.
2.  Put a recent timetable at tt.csv
3.  Put week definitions (if different from included) at weeks.csv
4.  Run with python3.4 (probably works with other python3-\* but was not tested)
